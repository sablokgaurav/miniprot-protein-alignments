# miniprot_protein_alignments
a minprot alignments to get the alignment ranges for the protein malignments that were done to generate the hints and also to generate the tabulated table for the length preparation. Run the miniprot as the following 

```
./miniprot --gff test/DPP3-hs.gen.fa.gz test/DPP3-mm.pep.fa.gz > aln.gff 
miniprotalignment("/home/gaurav/Desktop/aln.gff", splicetype="mRNA")
